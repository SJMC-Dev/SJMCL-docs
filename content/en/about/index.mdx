## About SJMC

Shanghai Jiao Tong University Minecraft Club (SJMC) is a cultural and artistic student organization composed of SJTU students who are passionate about Minecraft and its derivative content, founded in May 2021.

SJMC uses the globally popular sandbox game "Minecraft" as a carrier, and relies on virtual reality technology to shape the digital cultural experience of SJTU. The club's core project is the "Voxel-SJTU" virtual campus, which constructs a highly realistic, immersive, and interactive 3D digital campus, hosting virtual graduation ceremonies, academic conferences, designing digital admission letters and digital twins of cultural creations, and publishing multiple research papers, which achieves widespread influence.

SJMC encourages students to independently open up second classrooms in the virtual campus, covering areas such as programming, architecture, and circuits, allowing students to become instructors themselves. SJMC has joined with other universities to establish the "Minecraft University Alliance", developing a joint authentication platform for universities, and inviting industry experts to host discussion sessions, injecting new momentum into the digitalization of universities. SJMC has been recognized as an active university student club of Shanghai.

As sandbox game being suitable for all ages, Minecraft has, after more than a decade of development, given birth to a rich and colorful cultural community, involving fields such as circuits, programming, mechanics, architecture, and art. As long as there are ideas, Minecraft can become any type of game, and even more than just a game, but an educational tool. This is the unique charm of the sandbox concept. SJMC hopes to lead SJTU students with innovative spirits to delve deeper into the mechanisms and culture behind sandbox games, applying their daily knowledge in a relaxed and enjoyable way, and subtly exercising the participants' ability to innovate across disciplines.
