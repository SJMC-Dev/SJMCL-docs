1.1 When using the software, you must use the official interfaces, login pages, and other channels provided by the software for account/password input and consent to information authorization. Failure to use the official channels may result in account or credential leakage or other losses for which you are responsible.

In cases where the software merely provides a login interface, third parties are independently responsible for the legality, security, and authenticity of their offered websites, applications, or services. Any losses caused by third parties should be resolved with those third parties.

1.2 When using the services provided by the software you must comply with applicable laws and regulations (including the laws of your country or region if you are outside China), as well as any policies and rules related to the service. You must not use the software to:

- Publish or transmit content that violates law, endangers national security, undermines public order, or contains abusive, defamatory, inciting, violent, or otherwise prohibited material.

  1.6 If we detect or receive reports that your behavior violates this Agreement, we may take technical measures such as removing, blocking, or disconnecting relevant content links. Depending on the severity, we may suspend or terminate the service and pursue legal remedies.

  1.7 You agree to indemnify the Developer and related third parties for any claims, demands, losses, or legal fees arising from your breach of this Agreement.
