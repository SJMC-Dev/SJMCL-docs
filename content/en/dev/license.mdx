In addition to complying with GPLv3, Section 7 requires the following extra conditions (see the project LICENSE.EXTRA for details) when distributing modified versions:

1. Use an application name different from SJMCL or SJMC Launcher;
2. Do not remove the telemetry that reports usage statistics to our statistics server (`src-tauri/src/utils/sys_info.rs`), and when sending version information include a prefix of at least two alphabetic characters (for example `XX-0.0.1`);
3. In your project's README, distribution page, release notes, support docs, and the application's About page, clearly state that your program is based on SJMCL and provide a link to the original repository.
